# Website for Content Flow

## Code Institute Milestone Project 4 : Full Stack Frameworks with Django

Content Flow is an online community where users can view and share content in a variety of different categories. Registered users will be able to follow categories and other users of their choice and they will also be able to reward each other with tokens, via their posts. The website will allow users to purchase tokens using the Stripe Authentication Software and users will also be able to convert and withdraw their tokens as cash for financial gain.

The website will feature a landing page with information about the community and how it works, encouraging users to sign up. Users will be able to view the main website and content without signing up, however, they will need a registered account to access the full experience. (post content, comment, likes, send/receive rewards etc.) The website will make use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front end and Python with the Django Framework for the backend. It will also incorporate a PostgreSQL relational database system with full CRUD functionality.
