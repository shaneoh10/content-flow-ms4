# Content Flow - Testing

[Back to README.md](README.md)

## Chrome Developer Tools

I used Chrome Developer Tools throughout the development of the project to assist with the design and layout of each page. This is a great tool to use when implementing or making changes to HTML and CSS code as it allows you to test various font sizes, margin, padding etc. before committing any changes to the project. I also found it very useful to help me find exactly which elements needed to be targeted in the DOM when making visual changes to the pages (JQuery effects, media queries etc.) and when getting input values from forms. I am satisfied with how the website turned out and I think it is clear and easy to read on mobile, tablet and desktop. Overall, I think the best experience is on desktop as there is no content hidden to save screen space but I believe the mobile experience is great for someone on the go as it contains all the most important content and is easy to read, navigate and interact with the website.
